Thank you for the clarification. I'll reformat the second README based on the style and formatting of the first README.

# Terraform Remote Backend

## Aim
* Deploy VNet peering infrastructure and enable testing of intersite connectivity using Terraform with a remote backend.
* Deployment is performed using the Azure CLI and Terraform installed in your environment.
  * **[Install Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)**
  * **[Install Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install)**

## Deployment 

### Deploy Remote Backend Infrastructure and terraform config 
1. **Deploy a storage account to store the remote state:** 
   - Run the `pre-req.ps1` script.
2. **Navigate to the `az-infra` directory and deploy Terraform configuration:**
   - **Initialize Terraform:** `terraform init`
   - **Validate the Terraform configuration:** `terraform validate`
   - **Plan the Terraform deployment:** `terraform plan`
   - **Apply the Terraform configuration:** `terraform apply --auto-approve`

## Testing 
1. **Review the state of the Terraform state file:**
   - While deploying the Terraform configuration in Azure, check the state file to ensure that the infrastructure is being correctly deployed.
